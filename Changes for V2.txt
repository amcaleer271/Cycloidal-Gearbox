Higher Gear Reduction - At least  15:1
Smaller Scale - Should be inside or close to dimensions of nema
Less screws
Should be small enough to not need counter rotating disk
Instead of pins for power transmission, use a circular faceplate with pins that insert into holes in the cycloidal disk like in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsS9-FzKN6s
Less total parts if possible
Run shaft of motor into and through gearbox to reduce size and remove need for mount piece
Either universal mount on front or easily interchangable front plate
Easy access to repair or lubricate
Less screws and screw holes to attach surfaces, all it takes is 3/4 to be secure in most cases
Support the motor so it isnt just hanging off the gearbox, just a little bit to hopefully reduce vibration and ensure a snug fit.
Add rim for raised area on front surface of NEMA 17
